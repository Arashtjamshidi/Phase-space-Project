# Phase-space-Project
In this project we trying to simulate trajectory of pendulum which is connected to a disk, and the disk it self has an angular momentum Omega and analysis phase space of Omega and the pendulum initial angel at t = 0.
we use Lagrangian mechanics and Euler-Lagrange equation to analysis this problem.
